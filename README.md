Creating a user-based movie recommendation system using Python, the TMDB API, and a SQL database is a great project. Here's a structured workflow to guide you through the development process:

### 1. Project Setup
- **Environment Setup:** Install Python and set up a virtual environment for your project.
- **Dependencies:** Install necessary libraries (`requests` for API calls, `SQLAlchemy` or similar for database interaction, a web framework like `Flask` or `Django` for the frontend).

### 2. TMDB API Integration
- **API Key:** Register on TMDB to obtain an API key.
- **API Exploration:** Familiarize yourself with the TMDB API; understand how to retrieve movie details, search movies, etc.
- **API Wrapper:** Write a Python class or module to interact with the TMDB API using the `requests` library.

### 3. Database Setup
- **Database Schema:** Design a SQL database schema to store user data and watched movies.
- **ORM Setup:** Use an ORM like SQLAlchemy to interact with your database in Python.
- **Database Operations:** Implement functions to add, update, and retrieve user data and movie preferences.

### 4. Recommendation Logic
- **Algorithm Design:** Decide on a recommendation algorithm (e.g., content-based filtering, collaborative filtering).
- **Implementation:** Write the logic in Python to generate movie recommendations based on user's watched movies and ratings.
- **Integration with TMDB:** Ensure the recommendation logic utilizes TMDB's data effectively.

### 5. Frontend Development
- **Framework Choice:** Choose a web framework (Flask for simplicity, Django for more features).
- **User Interface:** Design a simple user interface where users can add movies to their watched list, rate them, and view recommendations.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration:** Use your web framework to connect the frontend with the Python backend (API calls, database interactions).

### 6. User Authentication (Optional)
- **Authentication System:** If needed, implement a user login system to personalize recommendations.
- **Session Management:** Manage user sessions to keep track of individual user data.

### 7. Testing
- **Dummy Data:** Script Dummy data for the SQL database where random users wit libraries like `Faker` and random movies qith random ids from TMDB and asign ratings to them using the api data.
- **Unit Testing:** Write tests for your API integrations, database operations, and recommendation logic.
- **Frontend Testing:** Test the user interface for usability and bugs.

### 8. Deployment
- **Deployment Platform:** Choose a platform for deployment (Heroku, AWS, etc.).
- **Deployment Setup:** Deploy your application, ensuring that the environment is properly set up for Python, the web server, and the database.

### 9. Documentation and Maintenance
- **Documentation:** Document your code, API endpoints, and how to use the application.
- **Maintenance Plan:** Set up a plan for maintaining and updating the application.

### 10. Future Enhancements
- **Feedback System:** Implement a system for users to provide feedback on recommendations.
- **Continuous Learning:** Enhance the recommendation system to learn from user feedback and improve over time.
