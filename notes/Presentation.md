## Project intro

First of all, like many people, I have a hard time finding movies that I might like when I’m ready to watch something. That’s because even if the movie looks great and would be perfect for me, I’m constantly thinking about finding a better one and keep scrolling through movies until I don’t want to watch anything else. With all the streaming platforms offering choices and our attention span shrinking, what should be a good time is turning into a waste of time.

This is essentially why any website providing products or services uses recommendations to encourage the user to consume or buy.

Recommender systems are, however, hard to build because of the data and computing power it needs to be efficient.

### What is content based filtering?

• Content-based

• Content-based looks for similar items based on the items users have already liked or positively interacted with.

• It looks for the items the user has consumed then it finds other items like the consumed item and recommends them.

• First, similarities between items are calculated.

• Second, based on the calculated similarities, model recommends the similar items that user has consumed.
